# Second challenge question for the Leet code 75 problem challenge.
- For two strings s and t, we say "t divides s" if and only if s = t + t + t + ... + t + t (i.e., t is concatenated with itself one or more times).
- Given two strings str1 and str2, return the largest string x such that x divides both str1 and str2.
- The solution uses recursion to solve the problem. I have also provided solution to find the shortest common substring, not required for the question but for fun!
